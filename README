Imagination is a lightweight DVD slide show maker developed with GTK+2.

NOTE FOR PACKAGERS:
===================

Before packaging Imagination (unless this hasn't already been done) please
comment line 22 in file src/support.c from this:

#define PLUGINS_INSTALLED 0
to this:
#define PLUGINS_INSTALLED 1

If you fail to do so Imagination won't be able to load the transitions and the
transition's images when the package is installed.

UPGRADE FROM 1.5 TO 2.0 NOTES:
==============================

Because Imagination's backend changed from 1.5 to 2.0, old transition plugins do
not work with new version anymore. This and the fact that some transitions have
been grouped together may cause some trouble if you don't uninstall previous
version of Imagination prior installing 2.0.

But if you did this already, there is a simple fix. Just navigate to
Imagination's plugin folder (PREFIX/lib/imagination) and delete remnants of old
installation by executing:
$ su
# rm -f fade.*

or 
$ sudo rm -f fade.*
