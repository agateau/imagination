Imagination is a lightweight DVD slide show maker developed with GTK+2.

NOTE FOR PACKAGERS:
Before packaging Imagination (unless this hasn't already been done) please comment line 22 in
file src/support.c from this:

#define PLUGINS_INSTALLED 0
to this:
#define PLUGINS_INSTALLED 1

If you fail to do so Imagination won't be able to load the transitions and the transition's
images when the package is installed.
