This is a list of improvements little by little while they come to my mind:

- Animated pixbufs showing the transitions effect instead of a simple static icon.
- Ability to add text on the slides.
- Audio effects such as echo, fade-out, fade-in.
- Ken Burn effects.
- Check if a slide is already imported.
- Import a video in the exported slideshow.
