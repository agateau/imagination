	 *
	 * Cairo surface data is composed of height * stride 32-bit numbers. The
	 * actual data for displaying image is inside height * width boundary,
	 * and each pixel is represented with 1 32-bit number.
	 *
	 * In CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, first 8 bits contain alpha value, second 8
	 * bits red value, third green and fourth 8 bits blue value.
	 *
	 * In CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24, groups of 8 bits contain values for red, green
	 * and blue color respectively. Last 8 bits are unused.
	 *
	 * Since guchar type contains 8 bits, it's usefull to think of cairo
	 * surface as a height * stride gropus of 4 guchars, where each guchar
	 * holds value for each color. And this is the principle behing my method
	 * of export.
